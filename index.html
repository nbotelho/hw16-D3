<ul>
	<li>
		A decent amount of correlation can be observed between the percentage of people who receive foodstamps, and those renting. This correlation however is not strong enough to definitively say that people who receive foodstamps tend to rent. The graph is not very linear. There might be other factors that come into play, which will need to be explored further.
